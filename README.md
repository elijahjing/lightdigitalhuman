# OpenGL 3D Model Renderer

This project is an OpenGL-based 3D model renderer written in C++ for optimal performance. It supports both physically-based rendering (PBR) and traditional rendering techniques. The renderer supports GLTF/GLB formats, with VRM format support under development. It is designed for digital human projects and references official GLTF examples. Suitable for learning and communication purposes.

Optimized for Android mobile platforms, this renderer provides efficient performance on mobile devices.
